Using SWIFT
### by d_llirium

The Clean Swift architecture is derived from the Clean Architecture proposed by Uncle Bob. They share many common concepts such as the components, boundaries, and models. I’m going to implement the same create order use case in one of Uncle Bob’s talks. While Uncle Bob demonstrates the Clean Architecture using Java in web applications, I’ll show you how to apply Clean Architecture using Swift in iOS projects.
